When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are collaborating on a project with other people or when you know that you will be working on the same project from mulitple machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you might not be ready to make commited changes public on GitHub!
