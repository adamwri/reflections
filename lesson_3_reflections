When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you are collaborating on a project with other people or when you know that you will be working on the same project from mulitple machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because you might not be ready to make commited changes public on GitHub!

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork - clone on GitHub server; use to create a copy of someone else's work

Clone - copy of GitHub commits; use to copy from GitHub to local machine or to make copy on local machine

Branch - commits on a diffferent "reachability" path; use to experiment with changes
